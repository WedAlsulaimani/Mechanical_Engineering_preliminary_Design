# Mechanical_Engineering_preliminary_Design

This repository contains the CAD design and technical specifications for a robotic arm mounting bracket. This mechanical part is designed to serve as a joint or motor holder in a robotic arm assembly, providing structural support and enabling precise rotational motion.

Description
This part features:
    Two vertical arms with large circular holes — ideal for axles, shafts, or mounting pins.
    A rounded base with four smaller holes — providing flexibility for secure attachment to a rotating plate, servo motor, or another frame element.
    Chamfered edges and a robust shape for structural integrity and ease of manufacturing.
